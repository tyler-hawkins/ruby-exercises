# The Odin Project Ruby Exercises - Tyler Hawkins

## About this repository

This repository is a complement to the Ruby course for The Odin Project. It contains a series of Ruby exercises alongside pre-written tests that will help guide the student towards a solution, providing a Test Driven Development experience.

Each set of exercises is completed by me after the corresponding Ruby lesson.
